As the Christmas countdown begins, I am dedicating my time to cleaning and organizing. 
I'm also looking to hang some of my art pieces on the sloping walls of my under-roof room. 

Simple screws won't do, as the walls are not flat. I'll have to find another way to secure them.

3d printer comes to the rescue!
The adapter is held in place with one or two 2.5x12mm wooden screws. For smaller frames, two adapters suffice; for larger frames, three or four will provide a more secure fit.

For a wall, I use screws with a head diameter of 6mm. 

[Download 3d model of the adapter.](/files/3d_models/Guitar/PictureKeyHole.3mf), it is in a public domain.
