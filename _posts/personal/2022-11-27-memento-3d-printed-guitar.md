My father was a passionate guitarist.
I remember him playing on holidays, and weekends, for our family friends. 
Especially on summer days, we used to gather in the park with family and friends. In the sizzling air of Kyiv summer my father played, and my mother was singing. I was playing football and beach volleyball on the grass with other kids. I loved to hear the sound of the guitar. The rhythmic beat of my father's hands created a clanging melody out of thin air. 

His guitar was old, sunburned, and covered in small cracks. 
When I was in the 3rd grade, my parents signed me up for guitar lessons.
I hated guitar lessons.
I got the old guitar from my father. I put it into the protective bag. Each time crossing staircases from my apartment to the elevator, I counted steps with the dull sound of the guitar crashing into the concrete. Putting more small cracks in the rattling sunburned body.

One day, parents and teachers in school organized a talent show. Because I was learning guitar, I was voluntold to perform.

I was practicing this annoying etude for my exam, but I never performed in front of a bigger audience.
It was the longest five minutes of my life:
I sit down in front of my classmates and parents. 

I play.

Note after note, absolutely disregarding tempo, I managed to go through the first half of the etude. 
My palms are sweaty, and my face is red: the state of absolute concentration.
The eyes of my peers are on me. 

Suddenly, I forget the note! And the next one and the whole end of the etude.

Silence is eating me alive, the eyes of the people screwing me over. My memory is pristine. 
Everybody starts applauding, helping me to end the suffering.
But the etude is not finished, so I continue the torment the audience.
With shaking hands, I try notes, making mistakes. Humiliated, I continue to deliver sounds. After a minute of being in the catharsis of shame, which felt like an eternity, I finally completed the etude.
Here comes the second round of applause, and I run away from the stage.

After the performance, I put my father's guitar in the bag and never took it out.

20 years later, when COVID struck, I decided to teach myself to play the guitar. But I did not have any instruments to practice!
Instead of buying a new one, I designed the body in the Fusion360, and 3d printed it on my Anycubic Mega S out of PETG. 
The neck and other gear are cheap Aliexpress parts. The project cost me less than 100USD,  a lot of time for gluing, tuning, and fitting parts together.

It even sounds like a mediocre Fender.

I enjoyed building the guitar more than playing it!

The lesson of the story will be:
Do not force your passion. Some people like to play(my father), others like to build instruments, like myself. 
To find what you like takes failures and experimentation.
