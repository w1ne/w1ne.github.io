[Ceedling](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/ceedling) is the build system for C based projects. Ceedling combines CMock, Unity, and CException in one open source package for producing quality C code.
The first step to use Ceedling is to install it.


# Problem description

Ceedling documentation lists following command for installation (after installing Ruby):
gem install ceedling

After a lot of trial, looks like RubyGems is not able to pick up proxy on mine corporate Win7 machine.

![407 Proxy Authorization Required]({{"/images/img/2019-08-01/407_error.png"|relative_url}}){: .center-image }

What have been tested:
```
gem install ceedling -p http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@PROXY_URL:PROXY_PORT
gem install ceedling --http-proxy=http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@PROXY_URL:PROXY_PORT
```
All the commands above give:
```
407 "Proxy Authorization Required"
```

Setting environment variables via command line,
```
set HTTP_PROXY=PROXY_URL
set HTTP_NAME=USERNAME
set HTTP_PASSWORD=PASSWORD
```
results in the same error.

# Solution

[Fast and simple solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4418/how-do-i-update-ruby-gems-from-behind-a-proxy-isa-ntlm/4431) is to use local proxy, e.g. Fiddler. it does not require configuration and works out of the box.:  
1. Install and run [Fiddler](https://www.fiddler2.com).
2. Run RubyGems:
```
$ gem install --http-proxy http://localhost:8888 GEM_NAME_
```

RubyGems does not work behind NTLM proxy used in many companies. Currently there is no elegant way to bypass it natively, without using local proxies.
