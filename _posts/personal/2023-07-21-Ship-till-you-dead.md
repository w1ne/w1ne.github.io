Challenge: build 100 projects and make them profitable.

**Step 1: Choose a Niche**
Look for a specific tool, service, or calculator that isn't saturated in the market but still provides a useful function. This could be a tax calculator, a budgeting tool, or something completely different. Consider my interests. If I understand a niche well, I am more likely to build a better tool.

**Step 2: Create the Tool***
Use plain CSS, JS, other platforms, and technologies to build a simple implementation as fast as possible.

**Step 3: Drive Traffic**
Promote my page on social media, paid ads, etc. People should use it from day one.

**Step 4: Set Up Monetization**
Implement Google Ads, affiliate links, direct sales anything that brings money. Tool should start bringing money in one-year maximum. If not, forget about it.

**Step 6: Automate**
If a tool/service brings money, automate it as much as possible. Robots must work.

**Step 6: Exit**
Keep it generating money as long as it is possible.
