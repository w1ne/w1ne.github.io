As part of my later trend of organic diet I am starting an experiment on the hydroponics growing. The ability to be self suficient and eat own grown food is futuristic but in the same time old as a human kind.

We are the information and food we consume. Hydroponics is an easy way to tweak nutrients in the food as well as taste, chemical contents, growing perfomance. 

# Goal
The goal of the experiment is to gain knowledge in the how far I can go in automatic gardening and food production.

This post will contain a build log for indoor hydroponics system.

For the first build Nutrient Film Technique system was choosen as easy to make and effective design.  
# NFT system design

Part list for simple NFT system is listed below
