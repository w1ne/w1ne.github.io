I am a **Firmware Engineering Consultant** specializing in building reliable, battery-powered IoT devices. I help companies navigate the full product lifecycle: from rapid proof-of-concept to mass manufacturing.

My expertise lies in designing modular firmware architectures, ensuring rock-solid connectivity (BLE/WiFi/Cellular), and bringing legacy industrial systems into the modern cloud.

## Bio

As an Embedded Software Engineer, I connect industrial machines to the cloud. I do research and development for IoT systems, from specification to architecture, firmware, and validation.

I have gathered a diverse background while working as a consultant for companies building digital devices, ranging from aircraft fuselage design to smart water meters and locomotive data interfaces.

## Hobbies & Interests

In my spare time, I am a maker and lifelong learner. My interests include:

*   **3D Printing**: Building and tuning printers to create physical objects.
*   **Music**: Playing and building electric guitars.
*   **Dance**: Salsa dancing.
*   **Martial Arts**: Muay Thai.
*   **Public Speaking**: Active member of Toastmasters.
